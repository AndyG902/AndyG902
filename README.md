- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew. I've been a Doctor for the last 30 years. I figured it was time I broadened how I use my domain knowledge. 
- 👀 I’m interested in finding a job that will give me real world experiencing of using the skills I've picked up on the University of Salford Data Science MSc this year.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, cloud computing with Pyspark and Hive on DataBricks and AWS. 
- I've experience of coding in R, SAS and Python, and Weka, for clasification, regression analysis and clustering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that gives me practical Data Science experience, in any domain, not just medical.
